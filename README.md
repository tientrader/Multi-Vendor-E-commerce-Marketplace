## üèó Project Architecture

### Microservices Architecture

**Multi-Vendor E-commerce Marketplace** utilizes a microservices architecture to ensure high scalability, fault tolerance, and maintainability. Each service can be independently deployed, scaled, and updated, enabling flexible and resilient performance even under heavy demand.

#### Key Strengths of the Microservices Architecture

- **Service Segmentation and Domain-Driven Design**  
  Each feature is encapsulated within its own microservice, allowing teams to focus on specific domains, improving scalability and productivity. Services evolve independently without cross-service dependencies.

- **Decoupled Service Interactions**  
  Communication between services is achieved via REST APIs and messaging queues, ensuring minimal coupling. This design enables rapid scaling and updates without impacting other services.

- **Fault Tolerance and Resilience**  
  The failure of one service does not affect the others, ensuring continuous availability through mechanisms like circuit breakers and retries. Users experience minimal disruption even when issues arise.

- **Horizontal Scalability**  
  Services can be scaled independently to handle varying loads, ensuring smooth performance during high traffic periods.

- **Simplified Maintenance and CI/CD**  
  Independent service deployment and updates facilitate continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), accelerating the release of new features and bug fixes with minimal downtime.

- **Centralized Configuration and Service Discovery**  
  Tools like **Spring Cloud Config** and **Eureka Server** enable consistent configuration and automatic service discovery, ensuring high availability.

- **Advanced Observability and Monitoring**  
  Integrated tools like **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **Zipkin** provide real-time insights into system performance, enabling proactive issue detection and optimization.

- **Enhanced Security and Access Control**  
  With **Keycloak** and **Spring Security**, the platform ensures secure authentication and access management, protecting sensitive data and transactions with state-of-the-art security protocols.

  Java is the primary language for building microservices, leveraging its multithreading capabilities and high performance. It provides a robust environment for scalable and maintainable solutions, particularly for services handling high transaction volumes like payments and orders.

- **Spring Framework:**
  - **Spring Boot:** Enables rapid microservice development with minimal configuration, significantly reducing boilerplate code.
  - **Spring WebFlux:** Facilitates the creation of asynchronous APIs through reactive programming, ensuring system responsiveness under high loads.
  - **Spring Security:** Manages security across microservices, offering authentication and authorization features. Key integrations include Single Sign-On (SSO) and JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication.
  - **Spring Data JPA:** Streamlines database interactions through repositories, simplifying data retrieval and CRUD operations.
  - **Spring Cloud:** Provides essential tools for managing and routing microservices, enhancing scalability and flexibility in API development.
 
### 2. Service Communication

- **OpenFeign:**
  OpenFeign simplifies inter-microservice communication by automatically creating REST client proxies, reducing boilerplate code and enhancing developer productivity.

- **Kafka:**
  Kafka facilitates asynchronous communication between services, ensuring safe storage and distribution of messages.
 
### 3. Config Server & Service Discovery

- **Spring Cloud Config:**  
  Provides server and client-side support for externalized configuration in a distributed system. This enables centralized management of configuration properties across all microservices, making updates easier and ensuring configuration consistency.

- **Eureka Server:**  
  Acts as a service registry, allowing microservices to discover each other. This simplifies the management of service instances and endpoints, enabling dynamic scaling and fault tolerance by ensuring that service instances are registered and available for seamless communication.

### 4. Databases

- **MySQL:**
  MySQL ensures data consistency through ACID properties, allowing critical transactions to be processed accurately. It is configured with replication and sharding to handle high query volumes without performance degradation.

- **MongoDB:**
  MongoDB is employed for unstructured data storage, such as product information and user reviews, providing a flexible and scalable NoSQL solution.

- **Redis:**
  Redis acts as a caching solution to alleviate load on MySQL and MongoDB, accelerating data access and reducing the number of database queries.

- **AWS S3:**
  AWS S3 is utilized for storing large volumes of unstructured data (e.g., images and videos), providing a highly durable and scalable storage solution.

### 5. Identity and Access Management

- **Keycloak:**
  - **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Users can log in once to access multiple services, with support for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, providing seamless authentication across the platform.
  - **Social Login:** Allows users to log in via their social accounts (e.g., Google, Facebook), simplifying the authentication process and improving user experience.
  - **User Management:** Streamlines user registration, email verification, password recovery, and overall account management, ensuring a smooth user experience.
  - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Ensures that only authorized users can access specific features and resources, enhancing security and protecting sensitive operations.
  - **Email Verification:** Verifies users' email addresses during registration to ensure account authenticity and prevent fraudulent sign-ups.
  - **Logout:** Provides secure logout functionality by invalidating sessions and tokens, protecting against unauthorized access.

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):**
  JWT secures API communications with authentication tokens, mitigating CSRF attacks and enhancing data security.
