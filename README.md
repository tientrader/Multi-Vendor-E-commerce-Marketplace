## üèó Architecture Overview

### Microservices Architecture

- **Service Segmentation**:  
  Each feature is encapsulated within its own service, promoting focus on specific domains. This modular approach enables easier updates, better maintainability, and independent deployments without disrupting the whole system.

- **Scalability**:  
  Services can be scaled independently based on demand. For example, if a service experiences high traffic, it can be scaled without affecting other services, ensuring efficient resource utilization and consistent performance.

- **Loose Coupling**:  
  Services communicate via APIs and messaging queues, ensuring minimal dependencies between components. This decoupling makes it easier to update, maintain, and scale individual services while reducing the risk of system-wide failures.

- **Resilience**:  
  Fault tolerance mechanisms such as retries and circuit breakers isolate failures, maintaining system availability even if one or more services face issues.

- **Independent Deployability**:  
  Since each service operates independently, new features and updates can be deployed without impacting other services, enabling faster development cycles and reducing downtime.

- **Cost Efficiency**:  
  The ability to scale services independently ensures that resources are allocated efficiently. Services under heavy load can be scaled up without requiring additional infrastructure for the entire system.

  To optimize storage and enhance performance, AWS Lambda is integrated to automate image resizing and quality reduction. This process reduces file sizes, optimizes storage, and improves platform efficiency by processing images in real time before they are stored in S3. The seamless integration between AWS S3 and Lambda allows for efficient media processing.

#### Pre-Lambda:
Before Lambda integration, images are uploaded to S3 in their original formats and sizes, without any optimization.

![AWS S3](resources/awss3.png)

#### Lambda Processing:
Once an image is uploaded, Lambda triggers a resizing and quality reduction process, optimizing the image by reducing its size and maintaining an efficient balance between storage and visual quality.

![AWS S3](resources/aws-lambda.png)

#### Post-Lambda:
The optimized image is stored back in S3, minimizing storage usage while maintaining a balance between performance and quality.
